            <h2>Enduro (Atari 2600)</h2>
            <h3>Programmed by Larry Miller</h3>
            <p>
                THIS REVIEW IS NOT YET PROOF-READ. 
                <br/>
                When I decided to review games for this website, for some reason I was immediately drawn to Enduro on 
                Atari. The game has some sort of energy that draws me in, to the point where it may be my favorite Atari game that I own
                (Toss up between Enduro and Joust, but in Joust you ride on ostriches, so that's high praise). Visually the game 
                is obviously primitive by modern standards, but for the 2600 it's pretty impressive. The game attempts a 
                behind-the-vehicle racing perspective like Sega's hang-on would attempt, but 2 years earlier and on hardware
                that frankly might as well be a sophisticated rock and stick compared to the sprite-scaling monster that Sega's 
                super scaler hardware would be.

                Obviously the game doesn't completely succeed in this effort. The perspective is not at all convincing, the vanishing point
                    of the road is clearly visible in a disorienting way, and the size of incoming cars changes in a way that doesn't really 
                    resemble an approaching vehicle convincingly. But it works well enough that once you're engrossed in the gameplay the 
                    illusion really comes together. Beyond all this, the game has character! If you know the general level of quality expected
                    from an Atari 2600 game, you would know that this is where the story could've ended. A passable approximation of a 3D driving 
                    experience is more than enough to impress on the hardware. But in Enduro visuals and gameplay are interwoven in a way that 
                    makes the experience more than its parts.
                <br/> <br/>
                Enduro's gameplay follows this general formula: You start the game, and each in-game day with a certain number of cars that 
                you must pass. The day starts normally, but then progresses to snow (a strange daily weather phenomenon), dusk, night, dawn, 
                and then day again. If you haven't passed the required number of cars, you lose. What makes this interesting, to me, is how these 
                visual changes also effect gameplay. Sure, snow is straightfoward, with grip becoming worse when it's snowy, but the night 
                sections are where I get interested.
                <br/> <br/>
                Rather than just giving the game a darker palette, the dusk and dawn sections also replace the obstacle cars with just tail lights, 
                requiring the player to avoid the same vehicles but with less visual input to work from. Then, during the night section the entire
                top half of the road is obscured, requiring the player to slow down to avoid collisions. 
                <br/> <br/>
                The gameplay generally changingething I have a lot to say about. The Atari joystick only had one button, so a "modern" solution
                of using one button to accelerate and one to break couldn't really have been used. But interestingly the solution that was 
                used I think suits the game much better. Rather than using the fire button as a facsimile of a gas peddle as might be expected, 
                the car in Enduro is in something of a constant cruise-control state, where the fire button increases the cruise speed, and back
                on the joystick lowers the speed. This gives you greater control over the speed of your vehicle, which is important in a game
                where passing cars and avoiding collisions is the entire gameplay loop, but also it turns slowing down into a very 
                conscious action, rather than the reaction of letting go of the gas to slow down. 
                <br/> <br/>
                This plays into the risk-reward that really makes this game click as a play experience. The game obviously rewards speed, because 
                going fast is how you pass other cars, but it also <em>punishes</em> speed. The faster you go, the less time there is to 
                react to incoming cars. Especially during the night phase, if you're going to quickly you <em>will</em> be punished for 
                being greedy with your speed. 
                <br/> <br/>
                There are other things I could touch on about this game, like how the limited implementation of the road programming
                means that sometimes it will feel like you're spending ages driving in a big circle, but ultimately I think what I want the 
                takeaway to be here is that games are art, and not only games that were made after technology allowed them to be visual spectacle.
                Enduro is a game that took incredibly limited hardware, and created something that was technically impressive for the time,
                but I think still warrants discussion today. It kind of captures the feeling of a long drive that passes that precipice from day 
                to night, or night to morning, but in a more game-y way. It's got a vibe, it's art, and I think it's good art at that.
                <br/> <br/>
                In summary, Enduro bangs and you should play it.
                <br/><br/> 
                But don't take my word for it! 
                Thanks to the power of modern technology, you can play the game <a href = "https://atarionline.org/atari-2600/enduro">here.</a>
                Although be aware that in my personal opinion, the lack of RF noise really does hurt the experience.
