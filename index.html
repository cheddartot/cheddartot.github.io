		<h1>This is Cheddar's website, if you're here you're coolio!</h1>
		<p>but more seriously this is going to be my personal website, hopefully as time goes on you'll see me posting updates on neat projects I plan on doing, or maybe even something better, like adding some CSS! We'll see though. (maybe I'll even get ambitious and add paralax scrolling (it's pretty much the coolest thing a website can have.))
		but for now this is what we have, and this is what you'll get. So deal with it boy.
