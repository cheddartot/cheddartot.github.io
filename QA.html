            <h2>What is this website for?</h2>
            <p class= Answer>It's just for fun :3 <br/>I just wanted to make a little website to put stuff on for my own 
            personal enjoyment mostly. Definitely not a professional thing or whatever.</p>
            <h2>Why cheddartot?</h2>
            <p class = Answer>Cheddartot is a nickname/alias I've used for a long long time. That's why I'm Brie now,
                because of cheese!
            </p>
            <h2>Why is this website so ugly?</h2>
            <p class = Answer>
                Depending on when you read this, it's either because it isn't finished or because I targeted some strange 
                esoteric browser/hardware to view the site on (likely wii or dreamcast browser tbh). <br/>
                Or just because it's ugly :3
